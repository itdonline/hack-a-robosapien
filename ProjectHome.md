We have 2 [WowWee](http://www.wowwee.com) [Robosapien](http://www.wowwee.com/en/products/toys/robots/robotics/robosapiens/robosapien) and we want to extend their functions, such as:
  * autonomous behavior
  * [objects avoidance](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/ObjectsAvoidance)
  * following the line
  * [speech interface](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/SpeechRecongitionUsingGoogleAPI)
and [so on](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/Ideas)

Currently now we have done the following:
  * Got acquainted with RoboSapien. If you are new, see [useful links](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/UsefulLinks)
  * Added [Arduino hardware](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/Hardware) (board + Bluetooth) to the robot
  * Wrote [Java-based GUI](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/downloads/list) for sending commands via serial
  * Follow our [plans](https://code.google.com/p/hack-a-robosapien/wiki/Plans) for next workshops!
